# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This repository is currently a clean slate - all previous files have been removed to start fresh. The project appears to be intended for "La Belle Bretagne", a tourism website showcasing points of interest in Brittany, France.

## Current State

- **Branch**: `nouveau-design` (no commits yet)
- **Files**: Only `.git/` and `.idea/` directories exist
- **Architecture**: No established codebase or structure yet

## Expected Technology Stack

Based on previous context, this project will likely involve:
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Inter family)
- **Storage**: localStorage for user preferences/favorites

## Development Setup

Since this is a fresh start, typical setup would involve:
- Creating basic HTML structure
- Setting up CSS framework/styling system
- Implementing JavaScript modules for map, search, and favorites functionality
- Creating data structure for places/points of interest

## Future Structure Guidance

When rebuilding, consider organizing files as:
```
├── index.html              # Main application
├── css/                    # Stylesheets
├── js/                     # JavaScript modules
├── data/                   # JSON data files
├── images/                 # Assets and media
└── pages/                  # Individual place pages
```

## Development Commands

*Commands will be added once build system and package management are established*
